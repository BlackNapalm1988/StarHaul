# StarHaul

StarHaul is a lightweight browser game where you pilot a small cargo ship across a procedurally generated star system. Deliver goods, upgrade your ship and avoid cosmic hazards.

## Running the game

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. The game runs entirely client-side, no build step required.

## Controls

- **Space** – Fire weapon
- **E** – Dock/Undock
- **F** – Warp gate
- **Shift** – Hyperspace jump

## Debug Commands

Enable **Debug mode** from the settings screen to access these commands:

- `Ctrl+1` – Refill fuel
- `Ctrl+2` – Add cargo
- `Ctrl+3` – Spawn a nearby hazard
